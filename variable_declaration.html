			 <h3>Variable declaration</h3>
		    <p>
			The variable declaration guarantees to the compiler that the variable exists with the specified type and name so that the compiler can continue to compile further without knowing the full details of the variable. A variable declaration has its meaning only at compile time, and the compiler needs the actual variable declaration when the program is connected.
			There are two cases in which a variable is declared:
			</p>
			<p>
				1. One is the need to create storage space. For example: int a has already created storage space when it is declared.
			</p>
			<p>
				2. The other is that you don't need to create storage space, you can use the extern keyword to declare the variable name without defining it. For example: extern int a where variable a can be defined in other files.
			</p>
			<p>Unless there is an extern keyword, it is a definition of a variable.</p>
