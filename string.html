			<h3>Strings</h3>
			<p>
				Characters are the fundamental building blocks of source programs. Every program is composed of a sequence of characters that—when grouped together meaningfully—is in terpreted by the computer as a series of instructions used to accomplish a task. A program may contain character constants. A character constant is an int value represented as a character in single quotes. The value of a character constant is the integer value of the char- acter in the machine’s character set. For example, 'z' represents the integer value of the letter z, and '\n' the integer value of newline (122 and 10 in ASCII, respectively).

				A string is a series of characters treated as a single unit. A string may include letters, digits and various special characters such as +, -, *, / and $. String literals, or string con- stants, in C are written in double quotation marks as follows:

				A string in C is an array of characters ending with the null character ('\0'). A string is accessed via a pointer to the first character in the string. The value of a string is the address of its first character. Thus, in C, it’s appropriate to say that a string is a pointer— in fact, a pointer to the string’s first character. This is just like arrays, because strings are simply arrays of characters.
