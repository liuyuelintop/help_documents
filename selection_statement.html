			<p>C provides three types of selection structures in the form of statements. The if selection statement  either selects (performs) an action if a condition is true or skips the action if the condition is false. The if...else selection statement performs an action if a condition is true and performs a different action if the condition is false. The switch selection statement  performs one of many different actions, depending on the value of an expression. The if statement is called a single-selec- tion statement because it selects or ignores a single action. The if...else statement is called a double-selection statement because it selects between two different actions. The switch statement is called a multiple-selection statement because it selects among many different actions.
