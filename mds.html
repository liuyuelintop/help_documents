				<h3>Major data structure</h3>
				<h4> dynamic data structures :</h4>
				<p>
					Linked lists are collections of data items “lined up in a row”—insertions and deletions are made anywhere in a linked list.

				</p>
				<p>
					Stacks are important in compilers and operating system-insertions and deletions are made only at one end of a stackits top.

				</p>
				<p>
					Queues represent waiting lines; insertions are made only at the back (also referred to as the tail) of a queue and deletions are made only from the front (also referred to as the head) of a queue.

				</p>
				<p>
					Binary trees facilitate high-speed searching and sorting of data, efficiently eliminating duplicate data items and compiling expressions into machine language.
