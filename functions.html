			<h3>Functions</h3>
			<p>
				In C, functions are used to modularize programs. Programs are typically written by combining new functions you write with prepackaged functions available in the C standard library. We discuss both kinds of functions in this chapter. The C standard library provides a rich collection of functions for performing common mathematical calculations, string manipulations, character manipulations, input/output, and many other useful operations. This makes your job easier, because these functions provide many of the capabilities you need.
			</p>
			<p>
			The C language and the standard library are both specified by the C standard, and they’re both provided with standard C systems (with the exception that some of the libraries are designated as optional). The functions printf, scanf and pow that we’ve used in previous chapters are standard library functions.
			</p>
			<p>
			You can write functions to define specific tasks that may be used at many points in a program. These are sometimes referred to as programmer-defined functions. The actual statements defining the function are written only once, and the statements are hidden from other functions.
			</p>
			<p>
			Functions are invoked by a function call, which specifies the function name and pro- vides information (as arguments) that the function needs to perform its designated task. A common analogy for this is the hierarchical form of management. A boss (the calling func- tion or caller) asks a worker (the called function) to perform a task and report back when the task is done (Fig. 5.1). For example, a function needing to display information on the screen calls the worker function printf to perform that task, then printf displays the information and reports back—or returns—to the calling function when its task is com- pleted. The boss function does not know how the worker function performs its designated tasks. The worker may call other worker functions, and the boss will be unaware of this. We’ll soon see how this “hiding” of implementation details promotes good software engineering. Figure 5.1 shows a boss function communicating with several worker functions in a hierarchical manner. Note that Worker1 acts as a boss function to Worker4 and Worker5. Relationships among functions may differ from the hierarchical structure shown in this figure.
