			<h3>Structure</h3>
			<p>
				Structures—sometimes referred to as aggregates in the C standard are collections of related variables under one name. Structures may contain variables of many different data types—in contrast to arrays, which contain only elements of the same data type. Structures are commonly used to define records to be stored in files (see Chapter 11). Pointers and structures facilitate the formation of more complex data structures such as linked lists, queues, stacks and trees (see Chapter 12)
